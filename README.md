# This is a work-in-progress (not yet usable)

## Features

1. Everything is converted to coffescript
2. Shipped as a Rails 3.2/4.0 asset pipeline compatible gem
3. Includes [spin.js](http://fgnass.github.io/spin.js/) instead of a gif preloader
4. Preloads images with [imgpreload](https://github.com/farinspace/jquery.imgpreload)
5. Built-in support for turbolinks
6. Support for fully custom popup HTML
7. Does not stay in DOM when closed
